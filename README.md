# prem_relegation_predictor

This project uses historical Premier League match data to predict relegation outcomes for each team over the course of a season. It combines data collection (web scraping), feature engineering, and machine learning to generate probabilities of relegation after each matchday.

The goal of this project is to predict which teams will be relegated from the Premier League after just 5 games

## Technologies Used
pandas, numpy for data manipulation

scikit-learn for machine learning

matplotlib for visualisation

BeautifulSoup, requests for web scraping

Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and development
